• Population by Region (Continent).<br>
• Top 10 most populated countries. <br>

3. Life Expectancy <br>
• World Life Expectancy Rate, World Male & Female Life Expectancy Rate, World Fertility Rate, and Infant Mortality Rate.<br>
• Top 10 Country Life Expectancy. <br>

4. Migration <br>
• Total Refugees and Total Asylum Seekers. <br>

7. % of City Population to Country <br>

### 1.2. Solution

1. Data Collection <br>
• Collect all the data from different sources. <br>

2. Data Transformation <br>
• Extract, transform, and load data using Power Query. <br>

3. Data Reporting <br>
• Load to Excel worksheet for reporting.<br>
• Load to Data Model (Power Pivot) to perform calculations. <br>

4. Data Analysis <br>
• Build relationships, perform calculated columns, or build measures using DAX. <br>
• Create Pivot Tables for reports. <br>

5. Data Automation <br>
• Create a macro that will refresh data. <br>
• Create a macro that will export data into a new workbook. <br>

6. Data Visualization <br>
• Build charts, graphs, and KPIs.<br>
• Build dashboards that consolidate all the information. <br>
